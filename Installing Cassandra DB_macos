Installing Cassandra DB:

1) ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

>Install Python

>>Mac OS X has a copy of Python preinstalled, but this makes sure you get the newest version.

2) brew install python

>Install cql

>>To use cqlsh, the Cassandra query language shell, you need to install cql:

3) pip2 install cql
4) pip2 install cassandra-driver

>Install Cassandra

>>This installs Apache Cassandra:

5)brew install cassandra

>Start Cassandra
6) brew services start cassandra

>Stop Cassandra
7) brew services stop cassandra


>Access cassandra db
8) Go to terminal and type  : cqlsh
You should see an output as : Connected to Test Cluster at 127.0.0.1:9042.
